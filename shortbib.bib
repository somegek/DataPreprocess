	abstract = {Two separate sets of forecasts of airline passenger data have been combined to form a composite set of forecasts. The main conclusion is that the composite set of forecasts can yield lower mean-square error than either of the original forecasts. Past errors of each of the original forecasts are used to determine the weights to attach to these two original forecasts in forming the combined forecasts, and different methods of deriving these weights are examined.},

	abstract={In applied forecasting, there is a trade-off between in-sample fit and out-of-sample forecast accuracy. Parsimonious model specifications typically outperform richer model specifications. Consequently, there is often predictable information in forecast errors that is difficult to exploit. However, we show how this predictable information can be exploited in forecast combinations. In this case, optimal combination weights should minimize conditional mean squared error, or a conditional loss function, rather than the unconditional variance as in the commonly used framework of Bates and Granger (1969). We prove that our conditionally optimal weights lead to better forecast performance. The conditionally optimal weights support other forward-looking approaches to combining forecasts, where the forecast weights depend on the expected model performance. We show that forward-looking},

	abstract={Combinations of point forecasts from expert forecasters are known to frequently outperform individual forecasts. It is also well documented that combination by simple averaging very often has performance superior to that of more sophisticated combinations. This empirical fact is referred to as the ‘forecast combination puzzle’ in the literature. In this paper, we propose a combination method that exploits this puzzle. Rather than averaging over all forecasts, our method optimally selects forecasts for averaging. The problem of optimal selection is solved using integer programming, a solution approach that has witnessed astonishing advancements. We apply this new method to forecasts of real GDP growth and unemployment from the European Central Bank Survey of Professional Forecasters. The results show that it is optimal to select only a small number of the available forecasts and that averaging over these small subsets almost always provides performance that is superior to averaging over all forecasts. Importantly, this new method is consistently one of the best performers when evaluated against a wide range of alternative forecast combination methods.},
