\subsection{Standard Approach}\label{standard-approach}}

Consider the two variable case. We have two forecasts, \(y_1\) and
\(y_2\), of the true variable \(y\). We want to combine \(y_1\) and
\(y_2\) with a weight \(w\) that we have \(y_c = w y_1 + (1-w) y_2\).
Assume they follow some distribution, e.g. \(y_1 \sim D(0,\sigma_1)\),
\(y_2 \sim D(0,\sigma_2)\), and \(corr(y_1,y_2)=\rho\). Then the
variance of the combined forecast \(y_c\) is \begin{equation}
\label{eqn: var yc}
Var(y_c) = w^2\sigma_1^2+ (1-w)^2\sigma_2^2+2w(1-w)\sigma_1\sigma_2\rho,
\end{equation} and the optimal weight with minimal variance is
\begin{equation}
\label{eqn: simple weight}
w^*=\frac{\sigma_2^2-\sigma_1\sigma_2\rho}{\sigma_1^2+\sigma_2^2 -2\sigma_1\sigma_2\rho}.
\end{equation}

\section{Survey of Professional Forecasters
(SPF)}\label{survey-of-professional-forecasters-spf}}

To illustrate the empirical results, we use the data from ECB
\textbf{(footnote link to data)} in this paper. The data, SPF, is a
quarterly survey initiated by ECB, with the aim to obtain future
estimates on inflation (HICP), RGDP and unemployment rate (UNEM) from
the private sector. Every quarter, a gourp of professional forecasters
from financial and non-financial instutition, such as economic research
institutions, respond to the survey with the idea on the future
economic. Starting 1999, SPF is the longest survey of macroeconomic
expectation in the euro area. Until the date of this paper, there are 75
quarters of observation available, with 1999 Q4 as the first forecasted
value, and 2018 Q2 as the last observed true macroeconomic indice.

The set up of the survey consist of multiple magnitudes of questions,
ranging from different horizon to different distribution. The
forecaststers are asked to provide their point forecast and the
probability of a certain scenario to happen. The survey enables ECB to
do quantitative assessment on the consensus of the market, like the
distribution statistics and standard deviations. For this paper, we take
the 2 most answered time periods, which is 1 year ahead and 2 year ahead
as our data set for all HICP, RGDP, and UNEM.

To compare the forecasts with the actual macroeconomics, we obtain the
true value from ECB data base \textbf{(footnote link to data)}. The data
cannot be observed from the economic in 100\% accuracy within the first
time frame, and exihibits changes to the initial estimates after
revision. We use the final estimate of the macroeconomics where
possible. The use of final estimate is fine is due to the fact that the
original forecast is not the real target to be forecasts.

Within the datasets, not all forecasters did a forecast every time
period. To avoid singular outliers, we remove all forecasters with a
total forecasted period of less than 24 quarter (6 years). The removal
approach is inline with \textbf{(ref paper)}.

Following \textbf{(ref paper)}, we calculate the covariance by looking
at the intersection between each forecasters.

\textbf{insert equation}

When there are no intersection between 2 forecasters, we set the
covariance value to 0. Additionally, we calculate the correlation by
using the covariance divided by the standard deviation. Standard
deviation is obtained from the square root of the diagonal.

\begin{equation}
\label{eqn: cov2cor}
\rho_{i,j} = \frac{\sigma_{i,j}}{\sigma_{i}\sigma_{j}}
\end{equation}

The cleaned up gives us a preliminary view on the SPF data without the
noises.

In figure \autoref{fig: SPF data illustration} and table
\autoref{tab: correlation summary statistics} we show the plots of the
forecasts along side with the true value in the macroeconomics and the
statistics of the covariance of the forecast error. To avoid too many
lines on the figure by plotting all forecasts, we plot only the minimum,
mean, and maximum from the forecasts. We see that there exist a high
consistency across all forecasts, with 2 year ahead stronger than 1
year. The consistency in the forecast is lower in UNEM than the other
two. Furthermore, many true values lies outside of the forecast range,
with RGDP the worse of all three. More values outside of the forecast
range suggest that restricting positive weights may be a strong
limitation in the forecast combination. We expect to have large effect
using truncation in the forecast of RGDP, while HICP and UNEM does not
have too strong effect. We also expect the 2 year ahead forecast will be
better than the 1 year ahead.

The table \autoref{tab: correlation summary statistics} tell us on how
the forecast error are correlated. The correlation are split up into
different forecast topics and different forecast horizons. Diagonal
element of the correlation matrix is not within the correlation when
generating the summary statistics. For all of the series, the
correlations are on average above 60\%. In HICP and UNEM the correlation
increases across all statistics when the forecast horizon increases,
while RGDP remains the same. The lowest correlation to be found is
-0.02, but this number is not too different than the minimum correlation
in the other two topics.
