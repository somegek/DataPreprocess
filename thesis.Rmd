# Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF)
To illustrate the empirical results, we use the data from ECB **(footnote link to data)** in this paper. The data, SPF, is a quarterly survey initiated by ECB, with the aim to obtain future estimates on inflation (HICP), RGDP and unemployment rate (UNEM) from the private sector. Every quarter, a gourp of professional forecasters from financial and non-financial instutition, such as economic research institutions, respond to the survey with the idea on the future economic. Starting 1999, SPF is the longest survey of macroeconomic expectation in the euro area. Until the date of this report, there are 75 quarters of observation available, with 1999 Q4 as the first forecasted value, and 2018 Q2 as the last observed true macroeconomic indice.

The set up of the survey consist of multiple magnitudes of questions, ranging from different horizon to different distribution. The forecaststers are asked to provide their point forecast and the probability of a certain scenario to happen. This enables ECB to do quantitative assessment on the consensus of the market, like the distribution statistics and standard deviations. For this paper, we take the 2 most answered time periods, which is 1 year ahead and 2 year ahead as our data set for all HICP, RGDP, and UNEM.

To compare the forecasts with the actual macroeconomics, we obtain the true value from ECB data base **(footnote link to data)**. The data cannot be observed from the economic in 100% accuracy within the first time frame, and exihibits changes to the initial estimates after revision. We use the final estimate of the macroeconomics where possible. This is due to the fact that the original forecast is not the real target to be forecasts.

Within the datasets, not all forecasters did a forecast every time period. To avoid singular outliers, we remove all forecasters with a total forecasted period of less than 24 quarter (6 years). This approach is inline with **(ref paper)**.

This gives us a preliminary view on the SPF data without the noises.

In figure \ref{SPF data illustration} and table **(label table)** we show the plots of the forecasts along side with the true value in the macroeconomics and the statistics of the covariance of the forecast error. To avoid too many lines on the figure by plotting all forecasts, we plot only the minimum, mean, and maximum from the forecasts. We see that there exist a high consistency across all forecasts, with 2 year ahead stronger than 1 year. The consistency in the forecast is lower in UNEM than the other two. Furthermore, many true values lies outside of the forecast range, with RGDP the worse of all three. This suggest that restricting positive weights may be a strong limitation in the forecast combination. We expect to have large effect using truncation in the forecast of RGDP, while HICP and UNEM does not have too strong effect. We also expect the 2 year ahead forecast will be better than the 1 year ahead.
